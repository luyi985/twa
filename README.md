Assumptions
1. The light box should be positioned in the centre of the page (both vertical and
horizontal) and have a light grey opacity behind
2. The progress bar should start at 0 and finish at 100
3. The speed of the animation should be retrieved from data.json in the js file and
loaded via AJAX
4. The progress bar animation should start on window load after data retrieved from
data.json
5. There should be a reset function on the main page
6. This needs to be IE8 + compliant
